I've loved GitHub Actions since they were released, but the one piece I always felt was missing was some kind of gating or more control around deployments. Now we can add manual approval requirements to our workflows through GitHub's new **Environments** configurations. Environments also support environment specific secrets in additional to repository-wide secrets.

## Create Environments

To demo environments and approvals I've created a simple .net web app, along with two Azure Web Apps (dev and prod). We'll setup GitHub Actions to deploy our code to our Azure Web Apps.

Let's start by creating our first environment for our project. From your GitHub repo access **Settings**, and you should now see **Environments** in the left menu.

![env1](/images/gh-approvals/env1.png)

Click **New environment**, provide a name, and click **Configure environment**.

{: .box-note}
Note: If you target an environment name in your GitHub Actions workflow file and that environment name does not exist GitHub will automatically create it for you. Only repository admins can configure environments with required reviewers, timers, and secrets.

Check the box for **Required reviewers** and enter at least user or team name, and click **Save protection rules**.

![reviewer1](/images/gh-approvals/reviewer1.png)

For this project I've created a `dev` environment and a `prod` environment. You can create as many environments as required to suit your needs.

## Configure GitHub Actions

At a high level the workflow I need for this project looks like this:

- Build the .NET application
- Automatically deploy the application to `dev`
- After approval, deploy the application to `prod`

Now that we have the environments created, we can reference them within our GitHub Actions workflow file. Environments are referenced at the **job** level, so we will utilize three separate jobs.

The code snippet below illustrates how the environments are referenced in each job with the `environment: name` key-value pair. I've removed the individual steps within each job for readability.

```yml
jobs:
  build-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

  deploy-dev:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    environment: 'dev'
    needs: build-and-publish
    steps:

  deploy-prod:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    environment: 'prod'
    needs: [build-and-publish, deploy-dev]
    steps:
```

When any job references an environment the protection rules of that environment are enforced before any steps within that job are started. Because we are referencing two different environments we need to seperate our steps into different jobs, aligned to the environments.

GitHub Actions will attempt to execute all jobs in parallel. This is great for performance when jobs are not dependent on other jobs. Our workflow however does contain dependencies, so we must express those using the `needs:` configuration within each job.

Using multiple jobs also means that GitHub is initializing a new `ubuntu-latest` runner instance for each job. The files created by our .NET build job will be saved locally (and lost), so we will need to publish our .NET build artifact. The artifact is then downloaded with each deploy job. The full workflow code for this is shown later.

## Configure Environment Secrets

Our Azure environment contains two Web Apps (dev and prod), in order to deploy our code we are going to use the **Publish Profile** from each within our GitHub Actions workflow.

The publish profile is a block of XML code containing connectivity and authentication information that GitHub Actions can utilize to deploy our code to our Web App. This can be downloaded as a zipped XML file directly from the Azure Portal, or easily retrieved from the Az CLI.

```shell
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --name WEBAPP_NAME --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --xml
```

Each Azure Web App will have it's own unique publish profile. We're going to store each as a secret in our GitHub Environments.

From our GitHub repo access **Settings**, **Environments**, and click on an environment to configure. Under Environment secrets, click **Add secret**.

Use the secret name **AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE**, and paste the XML block in the value, and click Add secret.

![secret1](/images/gh-approvals/secret1.png)

Once we've added the **AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE** secret to our first environment (`dev`), repeat the steps to add a secret with the same name to our second environment (`prod`). Make sure you grab the publish profile XML code from the prod environment and add that to the secret value.

Now that we have the secrets stored in each environment we can reference them from our GitHub Actions workflow yaml file.

In the code snippet below notice that the `Deploy to Azure WebApp` step is accessing our secret using `${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}`. Because this job is referencing our `dev` environment, GitHub will use the secret stored in that environment.

```yaml
  deploy-dev:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
    environment: 'dev'
    needs: build-and-publish
    steps:

      # Download published artifact
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: published-app
          path: './published-app'

      # Deploy to web app
      - name: Deploy to Azure WebApp
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: app-cloudlumberjack-dev
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: './published-app'
```

## Full workflow example

Below is the full GitHub Actions workflow yaml file to perform our application deployment, utilizing environments.

All of the code used for this article is available at my GitHub repo: [https://github.com/acampb/github-environments](https://github.com/acampb/github-environments)

```yaml
name: 'Deploy ASP.NET Core app to Azure Web App'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

env:
  DOTNET_VERSION: '3.1.404'


jobs:
  build-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      # Checkout the repo
      - uses: actions/checkout@master

      # Setup .NET Core SDK
      - name: Setup .NET Core
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: ${{ env.DOTNET_VERSION }}

      # Run dotnet build and publish
      - name: dotnet build and publish
        working-directory: 'app'
        run: |
          dotnet restore
          dotnet build --configuration Release
          dotnet publish -c Release -o './published-app'

      # Publish artifact
      - name: Publish artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: published-app
          path: './app/published-app'

    environment: 'dev'
    needs: build-and-publish
    steps:

      # Download published artifact
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: published-app
          path: './published-app'

      # Deploy to web app
      - name: Deploy to Azure WebApp
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: app-cloudlumberjack-dev
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: './published-app'

  deploy-prod:
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'

    steps:

      # Download published artifact

          path: './published-app'

      # Deploy to web app
      - name: Deploy to Azure WebApp
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: app-cloudlumberjack-prod
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: './published-app'
```

## Approvals in action

Our workflow is triggered by pushing to `main`, which will build and publish our application, deploy it to our dev environment, then wait for approval before deploying to prod. When viewing our workflow in GitHub we can see the `deploy-prod` job is waiting for approval.

![workflow1](/images/gh-approvals/workflow1.png)

Clicking **Review deployments** allows us to provide our approval and add some comments.

![approval1](/images/gh-approvals/approval1.png)

The deployment approval history is captured along with the workflow actions, providing some traceability to who approved, and any comments they supplied.

![history1](/images/gh-approvals/history1.png)

When approvals are required GitHub will also send the required reviews an email notification.
