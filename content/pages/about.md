I am a seasoned IT professional with nearly 20 years of experience. I have a deep background and extensive experience with Microsoft technologies. I am currently a DevOps Architect at [Softchoice](https://www.softchoice.com) where I help customers utilize Azure, GitHub, CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and automation.

I live in Pennsylvania, am a husband to an awesome wife, father to two young children, an avid baseball fan/player/manager/coach, and enjoy hunting and fishing.

*"Teaching, for me, is a repayment of something that was done for me. Itâ€™s a debt that I owe, not to the person who taught me, but to the people I have yet to teach." -- Don Jones, Be the Master*
